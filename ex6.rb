# excersizes
# 1 go through the program and comment above each line explaining it
# 2 find all the places where a string is put inside a string (tehre are 4) marked as q2(1) to q2(4)
# 3 are you sure there are 4?  Maybe I like lying - You're a sly fox, Zed
# 4 Explain why adding the twi stings w and e with + makes a string longer - Concatenation (heaven forbid the day I have to say this word out loud
# 5 What happens when you change the strings to use ' (single quote) instead of " (double quote)? Do they still work? - 
# Double quotation marks allow for escape sequences (ie \n to perform a line-break.)
# There are more differences, but they feel simple enough to search for rather than learn. ( famous last words)
